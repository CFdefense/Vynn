    Please use the established convention to generate new test cases for those marked as TODO 
    Please use the other previous test cases as the foundation of other tests.
    For example we dont need to login again in add permissions as test_login is already called.
    In addition we dont need to create a new document before adding permissions as a new document 
    has already been made in a previous test

    Please help me implement project permissions. Use document permssions as a model. Please stick 
    to my existing conventions, make sure to add to my migration script.  A Project is similiar to 
    a document in the sense that It has one owner but can haveother editors and viewers. Please update 
    exiting project apis to include inserts into the joint table of permissions when we create a project
