    Please use the established convention to generate new test cases for those marked as TODO 
    Please use the other previous test cases as the foundation of other tests.
    For example we dont need to login again in add permissions as test_login is already called.
    In addition we dont need to create a new document before adding permissions as a new document 
    has already been made in a previous test
