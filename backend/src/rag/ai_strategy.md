# RAG-Based Document Context Management for Chat Applications

## Key Requirements

1. **Multiple Documents in Context**  
   Users own many documents/projects. They need to select or automatically include relevant documents into the chat context.

2. **Dynamic Updates to Documents**  
   As users work, they may want to integrate other documents (e.g., research papers, previous drafts, notes).

3. **Contextual Relevance**  
   The system should identify and pull the most relevant document sections into the conversation dynamically.

4. **Efficient Retrieval**  
   The system must quickly retrieve relevant information, whether stored in a database, uploaded, or dynamically sourced.

## RAG-Based Flow for Integrating Multiple Documents

### 1. Document Management

- Users have multiple documents organized by categories (e.g., "Research," "Drafts," "References").
- Documents are stored and indexed for semantic search.

### 2. Document Selection

- Users can **manually select** documents to bring into the chat.
- Alternatively, the system can **automatically recommend** documents based on the user's queries (using metadata or semantic similarity).

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Relevant text is retrieved dynamically using semantic search (embeddings) rather than loading all documents into the model context.
- Retrieval is **query-driven**: based on what the user asks, the system pulls only the necessary information.
- Retrieved chunks are passed into the generation step to produce informed, context-aware responses.

Example:  
User asks, "Help me add the model from my research paper into this draft."  
→ RAG retrieves the model section → integrates it into the user's working draft via AI assistance.

### 4. Live Context Updates

- As users chat, RAG retrieves new relevant passages when needed.
- Example:  
  User: "Now match the tone of my funding proposal with my climate research paper."  
  → RAG fetches stylistic cues from the research paper.

### 5. Managing Retrieval at Scale

- **Relevance scoring** keeps only the most pertinent sections.
- For large document sets, **vector databases** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) handle efficient similarity search.
- Chunk-level retrieval prevents overwhelming the model with too much text.

### 6. Interacting with Retrieved Content

- Users can request:
  - Summarization
  - Rewriting
  - Tone/style matching
  - Content generation based on retrieved text

### 7. Document Versioning

- Changes can be tracked by version control:
  - Automatic save points
  - Manual checkpoints during editing sessions

## How RAG Fits Perfectly

- **Dynamic Retrieval**: RAG fetches just-in-time information based on user intent.
- **Efficient Context Management**: Avoids memory issues by not preloading entire documents.
- **Semantic Matching**: Embedding-based retrieval aligns better with user goals, not just keywords.
