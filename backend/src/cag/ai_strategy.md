### Key Requirements:
1. **Multiple Documents in Context**: The user can own many different documents or projects. They need to be able to select or automatically include relevant documents into the chat context.
2. **Dynamic Updates to Documents**: As the user works on a document, they may want to integrate or refer to other documents (e.g., related research papers, previous drafts, or different sections of their work).
3. **Contextual Relevance**: The system should be able to identify which documents are most relevant to the user’s current task and dynamically pull that content into the context of the conversation.
4. **Efficient Retrieval**: The system should efficiently retrieve and include text from these documents, whether they're stored in a database, uploaded by the user, or dynamically sourced from the app.

### Possible Flow for Integrating Multiple Documents into the Chat Context:

1. **Document Ownership & Organization**:
   - The user has multiple documents or projects in their account. These could be listed in their dashboard or via a library in your app.
   - The documents could be organized into categories or folders (e.g., "Research Papers," "Drafts," "References").

2. **Document Selection**:
   - During the chat, the user can select one or more documents they want to bring into the context of the conversation. 
     - For example, “Add my Research Paper on Climate Change and my Draft Proposal for Funding into this chat.”
   - Alternatively, the system might automatically suggest relevant documents based on the user’s current document or query. This can be powered by a simple content-matching algorithm or based on metadata.

3. **Contextualized Retrieval (CAG Approach)**:
   - Once the user selects or the system determines which documents should be used, the relevant text is **extracted** (using parsing techniques as mentioned earlier) and **included in the context** of the chat. This allows the AI to "see" and refer to those documents during the conversation.
   - If the user is writing a draft, and asks, "Can you help me incorporate this model from my research paper into the new proposal?", the AI can **retrieve** the model or relevant passage from the research paper and assist the user.

4. **Document Context Updates**:
   - As the user interacts with the AI (e.g., asking for suggestions or edits), the system could provide updates by referencing text from the various documents in the chat.
   - **Example**: The user might ask, "Can you rephrase the introduction of my proposal based on the style of the research paper?" The AI can then **refer to the research paper** (which was added earlier) and adjust the introduction to match the tone/style of that paper.

5. **Efficient Handling of Multiple Documents**:
   - Depending on how many documents are included in the context, the system should handle this efficiently. This means **keeping track of document relevance** (perhaps by tagging certain sections as important or frequently referred to).
   - For a large number of documents, techniques like **semantic search** (via embeddings) can be used to find and retrieve the most relevant sections of the document without loading the entire content into memory.

6. **Allowing Users to Interact with Their Documents**:
   - The user can ask the AI to make **changes**, **suggest edits**, or **summarize** sections of the included documents.
   - Example prompts: “Help me add a conclusion based on my research,” or “What’s the most important point from the third section of my report?”

7. **Document Versioning**:
   - As the AI helps update and revise the document, version control may be important to keep track of changes made. The system could automatically save versions or allow users to manually save checkpoints during their chat.

### How CAG Fits Into This:

- **Contextualization**: CAG is ideal here because it would allow the system to **contextually adjust** which parts of the user's multiple documents are retrieved based on the conversation's direction. It can not only fetch content based on the user’s query but also align the retrieved information with the **specific context of the user's current project**.
  
- **Dynamic Integration**: As the conversation evolves, CAG would dynamically pull the most relevant sections from different documents in the user’s library. For instance, if the user changes focus (e.g., switching from the research paper to a proposal), the AI would adjust its retrieved context to suit the new focus.

- **Semantic Matching**: By using CAG's retrieval mechanism, you can go beyond simple keyword-based retrieval and instead pull in documents or portions that are semantically relevant. For example, if the user is editing a proposal and asks for references on a specific topic, the system could retrieve relevant sections from a variety of documents the user has in their account.

### Tech Stack Considerations:

- **Document Parsing & Text Extraction**:
  - Use libraries to extract text from various formats (PDFs, Word docs, etc.).
  - Store documents in a way that makes it easy to index and retrieve relevant content (e.g., a database with full-text search capabilities or embeddings).

- **Contextual Search & Retrieval**:
  - For each document added, you could use a search engine like **Elasticsearch** or embedding-based models (e.g., **OpenAI embeddings**, **FAISS**, or **Pinecone**) to index the documents.
  - Use **semantic search** techniques to find the most relevant content dynamically when the user requests help.

- **Context Window Management**:
  - Manage the context window so that you can efficiently include the relevant extracted content from multiple documents without exceeding the model's token limit (which can be tricky for large documents).

### Conclusion:
**CAG** is the best fit here as it allows the system to **dynamically retrieve and adjust** the documents in the context of the chat as the user works on their current document. It allows the AI to understand which documents are most relevant, seamlessly integrating them into the conversation, and providing much more **context-aware and intelligent responses**.

### 3. Steps in Using Embeddings for Document Retrieval

Now, let's go through how you would implement embeddings in your document editing app for the chat-based context.

#### **Step 1: Preprocess Documents**

1. **Text Extraction**: 
   - Extract text from the documents the user wants to include in the chat. This may include PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files.
   - Clean the text by removing unnecessary characters, stopwords, and normalizing it (e.g., lowercasing).

2. **Chunking**: 
   - Large documents may need to be divided into smaller "chunks" (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, or even smaller units). This is important because embedding models often have token limits, and it's more efficient to work with smaller pieces of text.
   - Each chunk will be converted into its own embedding, allowing you to index smaller portions of a document.

#### **Step 2: Generate Embeddings**

1. **Model Selection**: 
   - Choose an embedding model. You can use pre-trained models like:
     - **OpenAI Embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002)**: A model from OpenAI that generates high-quality embeddings for texts.
     - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A deep learning model that generates contextualized embeddings.
     - **Sentence-BERT**: A modification of BERT specifically designed to generate sentence or document embeddings.
   
2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Pass each chunk of text through the embedding model. The model will output a **vector** representing the semantic meaning of that chunk. For example, a chunk like "Research on climate change" might result in a vector like `[0.45, -0.87, 0.22, ...]`.

#### **Step 3: Index the Embeddings for Efficient Retrieval**

1. **Vector Indexing**: 
   - Store these embeddings in a database or search engine designed for vector data. Common choices include:
     - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: A highly efficient library for similarity search of dense vectors.
     - **Pinecone**: A managed service that allows you to index and search vectors with high performance.
     - **Elasticsearch** (with vector search capabilities): A more traditional search engine that can also handle vector searches.

2. **Metadata**: 
   - Along with each embedding, store metadata about the original chunk (e.g., document ID, paragraph number, or any other identifier). This metadata will help you trace the embedding back to its source if the user wants to see the original text.

#### **Step 4: Retrieve Relevant Content Using Embeddings**

1. **User Query**:
   - When a user asks a question or requests an edit, you generate the embedding for the user's input (i.e., the query) in the same way as you did for the document chunks.

2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Perform a **vector similarity search** to find the most relevant chunks in your index. This is usually done by calculating the cosine similarity between the user query embedding and the embeddings of the document chunks. Cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are, with higher values indicating more similarity.

   - For example, if the user asks, "Can you rephrase the introduction of my proposal?" the system will compare the embedding of the query to the embeddings of all the document chunks, finding the most relevant ones.

3. **Retrieve and Display**:
   - Once you retrieve the relevant chunks based on similarity, you can send them back to the user in the chat. This allows the user to see content from their documents that is most related to their request.

#### **Step 5: Update the Document**

1. **Contextual Suggestions**:
   - Once relevant content is retrieved, the AI can use that information to provide **suggestions** or **edits** based on the context provided by the documents.
   - For example, if the user is editing a proposal, the AI can use the retrieved content from a research paper to suggest improvements in the introduction or match the style of the paper.

2. **Interactive Editing**:
   - As the user interacts with the chat, the AI may continue to pull in content from the documents that remain contextually relevant to the conversation. This makes the conversation more dynamic and personalized to the user's project.
